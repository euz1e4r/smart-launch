Smart on fire launch context servlet

This servlet is a stand-alone smart on fhir launch context writable REST repository. It allows
multiple instances of g1 EHR to register launch contexts via POST.
The single shared oidc instance then accesses the launch context via GET.

Packaging & Deployment
The servlet is delivered as a war file, smart-launch.war, which works when dropped into a JBoss
deployment environment. It is intended that the smart-launch.war share a JBoss container
with Open ID Connect.

Parameters
The servlet is dependent on and configured by these Java system parameters.
The parameter names intentionally match those of our Mitre Open Id Connect instance.
